Beneath the stars so calm and bright,
A whisper dances through the night.
In silence, dreams begin to soar,
To places never seen before.

Beneath the stars so calm and high,
The moonlight paints the midnight ske
A whisper floats on winds that roam,
And every heart finds thoughts of home.

On fields of green, the players dash,
With every pass, a sudden flash.
The crowd erupts, the goal is near—
In football's game, we conquer fear. 🏆⚽

Whispers of dawn in golden light,
Chase away the fading night.
Dreams dissolve in morning's hue,
Hope awakes, alive and new.
